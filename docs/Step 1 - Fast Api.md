Here are the detailed instructions for integrating [[FastAPI]] into the [[PolarSpace]]  project:

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It will be used to serve the data frames and handle API requests in the Polar Space project.

1. **Install FastAPI**: First, you need to install FastAPI and an ASGI server. You can do this using pip:
```
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
2. **Create FastAPI Instance**: Import FastAPI in your main application file and create an instance of FastAPI:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
```
3. **Create API Endpoints**: You need to create API endpoints for different functionalities like user authentication, file upload, and data visualization. Here's a basic example of how you can create an endpoint for user authentication:
```python
from fastapi import HTTPBasic, HTTPBasicCredentials

security = HTTPBasic()

@app.post("/login")
async def login(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)):
    correct_username = "admin"
    correct_password = "password"
    if credentials.username != correct_username or credentials.password != correct_password:
        return {"message": "Incorrect email or password"}
    return {"message": "Successfully logged in"}
```
4. **File Upload Endpoint**: Create an endpoint for uploading Parquet files. FastAPI provides a `File` type for handling file uploads. Here's an example:
```python
from fastapi import File, UploadFile

@app.post("/uploadfile/")
async def create_upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Save the file to disk or process it in some way
    # ...
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```
5. **Data Visualization Endpoint**: Create an endpoint for visualizing the data. This endpoint should accept parameters like the file name, schema, and the specific columns and rows to display. It should then load the data using Polars, format it using GreatTables, and return the HTML representation of the table. Here's a basic example:
```python
@app.get("/visualize")
async def visualize_data(filename: str, columns: List[str], start: int, end: int):
    # Load the data using Polars
    df = pl.read_parquet(filename)

    # Select specific columns and rows
    selected_data = df.select(columns).slice(start, end)

    # Convert to GreatTables
    table = gt.GT(data=selected_data)

    # Format the table
    # ...

    # Convert to HTML
    html = table.tab_html()

    return {"html": html}
```
6. **Run the FastAPI Server**: Finally, you need to run the FastAPI server. You can do this using `uvicorn`:
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
This will start the server on port 8000. You can then access the API endpoints by sending requests to `http://localhost:8000/endpoint`.
