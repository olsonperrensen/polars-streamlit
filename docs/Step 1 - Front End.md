On the front-end side, you would typically have a user interface (UI) that interacts with the back-end API provided by FastAPI. This UI could be a web interface built using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or it could be a desktop or mobile application. Here's a general idea of what should happen on the front-end side for the [[PolarSpace]] project:

1. **User Authentication**: The UI should have a login form where users can enter their credentials to log in. When the user submits the form, the UI should send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with the credentials. If the login is successful, the UI should allow the user to access their workspace.

2. **File Upload**: The UI should have a form for uploading Parquet files. When the user selects a file and submits the form, the UI should send a POST request to the `/uploadfile` endpoint with the file. If the upload is successful, the UI should display a success message and add the file to the list of available files in the user's workspace.

3. **Data Visualization**: The UI should have a form for visualizing the data. This form could include dropdown menus for selecting the file, schema, and columns, and input fields for selecting the rows. When the user submits the form, the UI should send a GET request to the `/visualize` endpoint with the form data. If the request is successful, the UI should receive an HTML representation of the table and display it to the user.

4. **Scrolling**: The UI should allow the user to scroll through the data. When the user scrolls, the UI should send a new GET request to the `/visualize` endpoint with the updated row indices and display the new table.

5. **Error Handling**: The UI should handle errors gracefully. If a request to the API fails, the UI should display an error message to the user.

6. **Logout**: The UI should have a logout button. When the user clicks this button, the UI should clear the user's session and redirect them to the login page.

This is a high-level overview of what should happen on the front-end side. The exact implementation details would depend on the specific technologies and frameworks you're using. For example, if you're using React for the front-end, you might use the `fetch` function to send API requests, and the `setState` function to update the UI based on the response.
