Mixtral Formatted from [[PolarSpace Transcript]]

The general idea for the project Polar Space is to have an easy-to-host workspace that can be interacted with via API, capable of hosting a set of polar frames and their disk representation in Parquet format. The workspace should allow users to visualize the polar frame and apply expressions or operations between them.

The computing stack consists of:
1. [[Polars]] for data frames
2. [[FastAPI]] for serving the data frames
3. [[GreatTables]] for converting the data frames into HTML code

Users would authenticate to access their workspace, which includes available [[Parquet]] files and the ability to upload new ones. They should be able to associate a polar schema with these files to simplify loading. The first capability users should have is visualizing part of the frame by combining Polars' select context, column selector, and slice operator to select specific columns and rows for display. It would also be nice to simulate scrolling up or down by calling the slice operator and updating the table representation accordingly.

In a second degree, users should have access to a text block that allows them to define [[polars expressions]]. Initially, this could be limited to a drop-down menu with options for selecting the expression context and frame over which it is applied. Users would then input a single step and the content of the expression as a string, which gets parsed and executed. It's essential to note that users should have the option to choose whether the expression results in a new data frame (default Polars behavior), performs an in-place operation by overwriting the previous data frame with the current one, or allows them to go back in time and cancel the effect of the operation. At this stage we are also supposed to integrate a login system. If we were able to do it, it would be nice to use [[LangSmith]], the frontend for logging from [[LangChain]] that a lot of people are starting to use. 

In third degree, users should be able to apply frame operations on frames within their workspace, such as concatenation or join between frames. Fourth, complex sequences of expressions should be possible through lazy frame and lazy expression utilization, allowing for multiple contexts and operations without constraints.

Fifth, the user should have the ability to visualize data not only through grade tables but also using a plotting library. Lastly, users should be able to specify expressions leading to visualizations using natural language with an underlying language model that translates to polar expression.
