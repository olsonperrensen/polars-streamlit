Sure, here are the detailed instructions for the first degree of the [[PolarSpace]] project, which involves setting up the workspace, authenticating users, uploading Parquet files, associating polar schemas, and visualizing the data using GreatTables.

1. **Setup the workspace**: Create a workspace that can be interacted with via API. This workspace should be capable of hosting a set of polar frames and their disk representation in Parquet format.

2. **User Authentication**: we can skip this for now.

3. **Parquet Files Upload**: After successful authentication, users should be able to upload Parquet files to their workspace. Implement an API endpoint that accepts a Parquet file and saves it to the user's workspace.

4. **Associate Polar Schema**: Allow users to associate a polar schema with their uploaded Parquet files. This will simplify the process of loading these files later. You can provide a form where users can enter the schema details and associate it with a specific file.

5. **Visualize Part of the Frame**: Use GreatTables to visualize part of the frame. Here's a step-by-step process:

   - **Load the Data**: Load the Parquet file using Polars. You can use the `read_parquet` function provided by Polars.

   - **Select Specific Columns and Rows**: Use Polars' select context, column selector, and slice operator to select specific columns and rows for display. For example, `df.select(['column1', 'column2']).slice(0, 10)` will select the first 10 rows of 'column1' and 'column2'.

   - **Convert to GreatTables**: Convert the selected data into a GreatTables table. You can do this by creating a `gt.GT` object with the selected data. For example, `gt.GT(data=selected_data)`.

   - **Format the Table**: Use GreatTables' formatting functions to format the table as needed. For example, you can use `fmt_currency`, `fmt_date`, and `fmt_number` to format specific columns.

   - **Display the Table**: Finally, display the table to the user. If you're using a web interface, you can convert the table to HTML using GreatTables' `tab_html` function and send it to the client.

6. **Simulate Scrolling**: To simulate scrolling, you can call the slice operator with different start and end indices and update the table representation accordingly. For example, if the user scrolls down, you can increase the start and end indices and load the next set of rows.
